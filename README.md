*Biophysical assessments of newly formed marshes in the Fraser River Estuary*

In summer 2023, Raincoast Conservation staff conducted biophysical assessments of both expanding and relatively stable tidal marshes throughout the lower Fraser River Estuary. This work was
in support of the upcoming postgraduate research of [Daniel Stewart](daniel.stewart@asarum.org) MSc RPBio at the [Martin Conservation Decisions Lab](https://taramartin.org), University of British Columbia.
Along transects runnning from the lowest elevation plant to top-of-slope (or right to the riparian zone in some cases), we collected high accuracy elevation points at 2 m intervals, described
the vegetation community associated with each point, and described 6 evenly spaced ~ 10 x 20 cm soil cores along the transect.
